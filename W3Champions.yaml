description: "Installs WebView2 + Battle.net + W3Champions. Note: Proton-GE-9-26 is recommended. You need to run Battle.net to install and then run Warcraft III at least once before W3Champions will work. Should the installer get stuck, for example after the installation of WebView2, then you have to manually kill the lingering MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process. That process might also prevent other installation steps from finishing successfully and thus preventing Lutris from advancing to the next installation step. A fully manual guide is available at `https://github.com/clemenscodes/W3ChampionsOnLinux`."
